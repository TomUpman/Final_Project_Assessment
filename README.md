# Final_Project_Assessment

Self-Assessment
	
	Analysis
		- My job role in this project was to create a data-visualization tool, via Tableau, that we would 	use for our presentation. The biggest personal hurdle that I had to overcome, was that I am not the 	most comfortable with Tableau, and on top of that the data we used was virtually uniform, making 	visualization of the data exceptionally difficult.
	
	Summary
		- My contributions to the other team memberâ€™s roles were mostly through team discussions, helping each other to work through any problems that might have arisen throughout the project.

Project & Team Summary
	
	Communication
		- We utilized Slack, Zoom sessions, and GitHub to communicate any and all work being done 	on our project.
	
	Team Strengths
		- The greatest strength that we had as a team was our prompt communication, and the strong 	leadership role taken by Lou. The biggest tip that I would give to a new cohort would be to make 	every effort to maximize communication. UTILIZE SLACK!!!

	Topic Addressed
		- Our topic was the use of Weather Data (specifically Air Quality Index) to help potential 	travelers determine the best cities to visit for the weather.

	Results
		- We realized that there is very little difference in Air Quality between different cities throughout the world.
